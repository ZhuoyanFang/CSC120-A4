- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
It helped me to think more carefully of the attributes for each class and what is private and what is public. With Encapsulation, coding became more organized and easier to go with for me. Thus, I did not have that much bugs and saved a lot og time.


- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
The engine class and the car class works well at first, and I spent sometime debugging the passenger class. Also, in Car, I could not directly print the name of the passengers, but then I found that I need to ues the name attribute in passenger class to help it work. My advice is to start with a small and basic and test each class separately before testing them together. Also we need to read the interfaces carefully, they are very helpful when we are coding each function.
